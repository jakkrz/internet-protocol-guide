# Communication Protocol Guide

*This project was made as a project for my IT course at school where we were meant to discuss a certain topic in the format of a website.*

The Communication Protocol Guide talks about the most basic internet protocols, that is, the Internet Protocol, UDP and TCP/IP. It also discusses some networking fundamentals such as the definition of an IP address and protocols.

The guide is heavily based on [An Introduction to Computer Networks](http://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/current2/html/) by Peter L Dordal at the Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago. A big thanks to him for making this possible!
