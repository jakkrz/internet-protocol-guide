        <h1>Internet Protocol</h1>
        <p>A very important protocol is the internet protocol, also known as IP. There are 2 versions of internet protocol: one for IPv4-addresses named IPv4, and one for IPv6-addresses named IPv6. IP serves as a foundation for many other protocols which are built on top of IP.</p>
        <p>IP packets contain two main parts: a header and a body. The header contains all of the metadata, and the body contains the actual information being sent in the packet. (Metadata is the data that describes the qualities of the packet, such as the length of the packet, the IP address to forward the packet to, etc.). The header of the packet is different for both versions of IP, so we will pick them apart separately.</p>
        <p>In order for computers to communicate, they each have a unique address known as an IP address.
            There are 2 types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. The reason we have two types is because
            when the internet was created, the creators didn't expect a lot of people to use it.
            There are only a limited amount of IPv4 addresses, and we are slowly running out of them.
            Therefore, a new format named IPv6 that we are slowly trying to transition to was created.
            While IPv4 uses 32 bits, an IPv6 address uses 128 bits. Furthermore, there are differences
            in how they work and what the different parts mean.
        </p>
        <h2>The IPv4 header</h2>
        <p>The IPv4 header is generally split into 5 or 6 words (a word being 32 bits). Here are the parts of the IPv4 header:</p>

        <p>The following table describes the function of each of these parts of the IPv4 header:</p>
