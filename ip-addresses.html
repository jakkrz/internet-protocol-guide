        <h1>IP addresses</h1>
        <p>Every computer has a unique identifier known as an IP-address. In this lesson, we will briefly
            dicuss IP addresses.</p>
        <h2>The two types of IP addresses</h2>
        <p>In order for computers to communicate, they each have a unique address known as an IP address.
            There are 2 types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6. The reason we have two types is because
            when the internet was created, the creators didn't expect a lot of people to use it.
            There are only a limited amount of IPv4 addresses, and we are slowly running out of them.
            Therefore, a new format named IPv6 that we are slowly trying to transition to was created.
            While IPv4 uses 32 bits, an IPv6 address uses 128 bits. Furthermore, there are differences
            in how they work and what the different parts mean.
        </p>
        <h2>IPv4 addresses</h2>
        <p>IPv4 addresses take up 32 bits and are typically represented as 4 bytes converted into decimal and delimited by dots. For example, 197.254.122.78 is the typical
            representation of an IP address. Additionally, each of these bytes is called an octet, since not all computers had 8-bit bytes in the days that IPv4 addresses
            were invented. (Nowadays virtually every computer has 8-bit bytes, so the words 'octet' and 'byte' can be used interchangeably).
        </p>
        <p>
            IPv4 addresses used to have a system where depending on the first byte of the IP address, different parts of the IP address signified the network address (a unique
            address to every network) and the host address (a unique address for every device on a network). However this was scrapped in 1981. Nowadays the system
            for determining the network and host part of an IP address is quite complicated and can vary from place to place.
        </p>
        <p>
            IPv4 addresses used to be received by <a href="https://iana.org">IANA</a>, but nowadays IANA delegates this task to 6 sites, each of which specialises in a
            certain part of the earth:
            
            <ul>
                <li>ARIN – North America</li>
                <li>RIPE – Europe, the Middle East and parts of Asia</li>
                <li>APNIC - East Asia and Pacific</li>
                <li>AfriNIC - Africa</li>
                <li>LACNIC - Central and South America</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>As of January 2015, ARIN has run out of IP addresses. Companies purchased ARIN IPv4 addresses from other companies
            in hopes that they could sell them for more in the future when demand grows.
        </p>
        <p>This is the reason we need to start moving to IPv6 addresses: we are slowly but steadilly
            running out of IPv4 addresses.
        </p>
        <h2>IPv6 addresses</h2>
        <p>IPv6 addresses are 16 bytes long and are typically represented as groups of 2 bytes written in
            the hexadecimal system (number system with 16 digits: 0123456789ABCDEF) delimited with colons (:).
            Thus, an IPv6 address can look like this: 2001:0db8:0033:0444:0000:0000:7777:0000. 0s Preceeding 
            the groups of 2 bytes can be ommitted. Additionally,
            if one or more consecutive groups of 2 are filled with 0s,
            a double colon (::) may be used once.
        </p>
        <p>This address can be condensed to 2001:db8:33:444::7777:0. Note that keeping the final
            group as a 0 is necessary, because if we used a colon, that would introduce ambiguity
            as to where and how many ommitted bytes should be substituted in. 
        </p>
        <p>IPv6 addresses are also split into a host and network part, just like IPv4 addresses.</p>
